# 🌐 Portfolio of Frontend Layouts

👋 Hi! I'm Nuraly — a beginner frontend developer from Kazakhstan.  
This repository contains my HTML/CSS layout projects. I created them by converting Figma designs into responsive, clean code. The goal: build a strong foundation in layouting before diving deeper into JavaScript and frameworks.

## 🔧 Technologies
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)
- Adaptive and responsive design principles
- BEM naming (in some layouts)
