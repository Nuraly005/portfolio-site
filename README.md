# üåê Portfolio of Frontend Layouts

üëã Hi! I'm Nuraly ‚Äî a beginner frontend developer from Kazakhstan.  
This repository contains my HTML/CSS layout projects. I created them by converting Figma designs into responsive, clean code. The goal: build a strong foundation in layouting before diving deeper into JavaScript and frameworks.

---

## üì± What I Do

- Responsive layouts for mobile and tablet devices  
- Semantic and accessible HTML structure  
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries)  
- Pixel-perfect implementation from Figma designs  
- Adaptive and responsive design principles  
- Email-style HTML sections  
- Clean and readable code using HTML5 & CSS3  
- BEM naming methodology (in some layouts)
